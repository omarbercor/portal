# Super Portal - UI Developer Candidate Project
## Overview
Your mission if you choose to accept it is to convert two web page designs into an actual web pages in a Rails project. We'll be reviewing the pages for how well you structure your HTML, CSS and even maybe your ability to use a bit of JavaScript. You might want to read up a little on where to put your CSS or ahem maybe SCSS in how to structure your files in rails project.

## Getting Started
We used the [Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) instructions to set up a new project in a repo to speed up your setup. You'll still need clone this repo and install

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/documentation/installation/) (2.6.3)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/gemfile.html)

on your local machine and then run 

`bundle install`

To install all the other required gems. You can then start a server which you can access at [http://localhost:3000/]() by running

`bundle exec rails server`

## Web Page Designs
The two designs that you need to page layout are:
- [Home Page](mockups/home-page.png)
- [Property Page](mockups/property-page.png)

In both pages there are carousels and we recommend you use the [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) which is already installed in the vendor directory.

### Home Page
The home page consists of the following:
1. Contact header with a search input
2. Menu
3. Hero image with your 2 main select filters with the following options:
    - Property operations: Sale, Rent and Vacation Rentals
    - Property Types: Apartment, Building, House, Land and Office
4. 3x2 grid of featured properties
5. An agent carousel with navigation arrows: [GIF](http://g.recordit.co/9B9bzxw1HZ.gif)
6. Contact footer

### Property Page
The property page consists of the following:
1. Contact header with a search input
2. Menu
3. Title and address section
4. Property images carousel with navigation arrows: [GIF](http://g.recordit.co/Ydct37Ak4g.gif)
5. Property details section with a contact form
6. Property description and amenities section

## Style Requirements
Make sure you code meets all the [style guide](style-guide.md) requirements.

## Deliverables
You should deliver the project sharing a link to your fork. Keep in mind that the code you deliver should be considered high quality and ready to be used in a production environment and reviewed by your peers. We'll review the code to see if it's clean, clear and uses good practices. Also be sure to replace the notes section below with your own notes.

## Notes
Add any notes here about your design decisions or improvements you would have made if you had more time. You also might want to consider the following questions for inspiration
- Are there any areas of your code that you think isn't that "clean"?
- What would you have done differently if you had more time?
- If you weren't able to finish, what were you able to complete and were you happy with your progress given the time constraints?
